    "text": "I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate at Weill Cornell Medicine in the Physiology, Biophysics, and Systems Biology program, working with Dr. Ed Reznik.\nMy research focuses on the relationship between obesity and cancer. More specifically, I am working on understanding how obesity influences the molecular biology of tumours and determining the likelihood that these differences may be related to how obesity is a major cancer risk factor.\nPreviously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Microbiology and Immunology at UBC and worked as a research assistant in Dr. Christian Steidl’s lab at the British Columbia Cancer Research Centre developing prognostic models and studying Follicular Lymphoma cancer evolution."

    "text": "Obesity is a major risk factor for at least 13 types of cancer, but how it acts as one remains unknown. Other well-known risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, and ultraviolet radiation are generally thought to lead to damages in your DNA, termed mutations. These are then thought to lead to abnormal cells that eventually, given the right conditions, become cancerous. However, obesity is unique from this perspective; no evidence has suggested that it is associated with mutations, and so how it contributes to the risk of developing so many cancers remains a mystery."
