## Lay summary

Obesity is a major risk factor for at least 13 types of cancer, but *how* it
acts as one remains unknown. Other well-known risk factors such
as smoking, alcohol, and ultraviolet radiation are generally thought to lead
to damages in your DNA, termed *mutations*. These are then thought to lead to
abnormal cells that eventually, given the right conditions, become cancerous.
However, obesity is unique from this perspective; no evidence has suggested
that it is associated with mutations, and so how it contributes to the risk
of developing so many cancers remains a mystery.
